# SVG-LOGO-MAKER
Module 10 Activity
# Description
This application is an SVG logo maker. This application enables a user to create an SVG logo by way of answering prompt questions and using the answers to create a logo. To build this application, I utilized objest-oriented programming. Building this application, I faced challenges with my code rendering the logo with color and text inside of the shape.
# Installation
To run this application, install VSCode, open an integrated terminal and run npm i. Next, to enable the prompts, in the terminal, run node index.js. 
# Usage
To use this application, open VSCODE, open an integrated terminal, then run npm i in the integrated terminal, then run index.js in the integrated terminal, then answer the prompted questions. After all questions are answered, navigate to the assets folder and click on the file logo.svg. A preivew of the logo.svg will populate in a tab. Additionally, you can  right click on the logo.svg file and select open with live server, and the logo.svg will populate in your browser.
